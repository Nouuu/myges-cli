## Agenda
The `agenda` command is a little special since it offers diverse options in order to ease its use.

### Listing weeks
You can list and select the week to display by using the `-i` option (alias of `--interactive`).

### Manual week selection
It's possible to manually specify the wanted week. Here's some possibilities:
- `myges agenda 19-03-2020` -> Shows the week from last Sunday to next Sunday of the date `19-03-2020`
- `myges agenda 19-03` -> Shows the week from last Sunday to next Sunday of `March 19` of the current year
- `myges agenda 19` -> Shows the week from last Sunday to next Sunday of the day `19` of the current month and year
- `myges agenda today` -> Displays today's agenda
- `myges agenda tomorrow` -> Displays tomorrow's agenda
- `myges agenda yesterday` -> Displays yesterday's agenda

A shifting can be added to the specified week:
- `myges agenda today+2` -> Shows the agenda of 2 days from today
- `myges agenda today+-2` -> Shows the agenda of 2 days ago from today

Those shifts can be applied to any manual week input using the same format (`+n`).
